[Intro]
Have you checked?
Have a look in the mirror
There's a fault, a crack
A flaw, a defect

Have you tried wrapping up?
Taping over?
Eating less?
Proceed, you're almost perfect

Swear by these results my darling
Self-improvement is my mission
You can try and fail to look like me
And I can make commission

[Verse 1]
Hey, your lips have a tilt
Have you thought about big
The space between your eyebrows is?
Have you heard?
If you breathed
It will give you double-chin
Sometimes it's bеst to hold it in

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all your fault
The ability to change is in your hands
Just slam the wall. Your bonеs too thick?
And simply grind them into sand
With my favorite brand

[Chorus]
Look at you, babe
You're almost there
With just another dime or two
The gods will surely spare you

Negligence is sinful;
It's good to care
I've heard your useless dumb excuses
Toughen up cause life just isn't fair

[Verse 2]
Every day
I wake up, and I do my morning shed
It's worth it, though I look insane
All the things that you never even thought about before
There's a new standard to attain

Don't make me laugh
There's a way to look 18 until you die
We'll do the math
There's a million useless trinkets you can buy
It'd be a crime not to try

[Chorus]
Look at you, babe
You're almost there
With just another dime or two
The gods will surely spare you
Negligence is sinful;
It's good to care
I've heard your useless dumb excuses
Toughen up cause life just isn't fair

[Bridge]
Don't you wanna give up?
All the things that make you unique?
Don't you wanna look the age of
Your biological peak?

You're just a kid
But that doesn't mean you get to just slack off
You're aging rapidly
You better not bend over, laugh, or cough

(Unless you want those ugly lines that show you've experienced human emotion)


[Chorus]
Look at you, babe
You're almost there
The time to hate yourself is now
It's good to be aware

You can picture imperfections
But you're running out of time
Let me point you in the right direction
Buy this foreign skin care line
(You're all ugly and it's all your fault.)
