[Verse 1]
But can we trust the author?
Are we sure there's a war?
Don't think the truth's unfolding
Source checking takes too long
There's too much willpower
Tears can't stop their flow
Can't bring back all the fighters
Cannot bury them all

[Verse 2]
Nobody has been hurt - that's fake news, so faux pas
The great space cruiser signals to us from afar:
No sentience detected on enemy's land
We destroyed the object, no one's hurt, nobody's dead
Nobody has been hurt - that's fake news, so faux pas
The great space cruiser signals to us from afar:
No sentience detected on enemy's land
We destroyed the object, no one's hurt, nobody's dead

[Verse 3]
Can't sit through all the hearings
Can't go through all the proof
It's nothing more than people
It's just death, stay aloof
Maybe there are reports that
Want us to not abide
I doubt we'll be concerned, I
Doubt we will pick a side

[Verse 4]
It's all about to end, won't take more than three days
It's all completely planned, kids will soon meet their dads
Such heroes with great honor, the feast will be great
A shooting range - not war, still it's about to end
It's all about to end, won't take more than three days
It's all completely planned, kids will soon meet their dads
Such heroes with great honor, the feast will be great
A shooting range - not war, still it's about to end

[Chorus]
Our kids are immortal
We are so pure and clean
Flying our cyan rocket
Closing in on heaven
The sun at the end of the tunnel
Shining its lights at us:
Meeting our goals on time - soon
We'll be there, we'll relax
Our kids are immortal
We are so pure and clean
Flying our cyan rocket
Closing in on heaven
The sun at the end of the tunnel
Shining its lights at us:
Meeting our goals on time - soon
We'll be there, we'll relax
