[Verse 1]
my voices are dupes
they're lying to me
they're singing to me
attempting deceit
your hair's a mess
there's rain and there's snow
not real at all
your dye's a good fit

[Chorus]
given that we can survive this summer
then we never ever will be in trouble
given that we can survive this summer
then we never ever will be in trouble

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
my diaries, they
are filled to the brim
with pain and with rage
resembling hell
your fins have been slashed
your fins do not work
now you are alone
not feeling so well

[Chorus]
given that we can survive this summer
then we never ever will be in trouble
given that we can survive this summer
then we never ever will be in trouble
(ooh!)
