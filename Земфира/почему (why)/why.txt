[Verse 1]
You were knocking, but it was unlocked
I was silent, drowning in my thoughts
I was lied to, it's still blazing hot outside
Tanned my hands, it took me many hours
Oh so tired by these eerie sounds
Toured the town from start to end with no daylight

[Chorus]
You suffocate me so tenderly
Smell this freshness just barely
About you I know everything, uh-uh, uh-uh
I'm singing our songs merrily
Just tell me why? La-la-la
Just tell me why? La-la-la

[Verse 2]
Tea is served, the window's open
And I'm so bored, I have been forgotten
Blinked and missed the crescent becoming a moon
Someone's knocking, but it is unlocked
And I'm lamenting, yeah, shattered by the world
Don't be stupid, I've never said that you are doomed

[Chorus]
You suffocate me so tenderly
Smell this freshness just barely
About you I know everything, uh-uh, uh-uh
I'm singing our songs merrily
Just tell me why? La-la-la
Just tell me why? La-la-la

[Chorus]
You suffocate me so tenderly
Smell this freshness just barely
About you I know everything, uh-uh, uh-uh
I'm singing our songs merrily
Just tell me why? La-la-la
Just tell me why? La-la-la
You suffocate me - tenderly
Smell this freshness just barely
About you I know everything, uh-uh, uh-uh
I'm singing our songs merrily
Just tell me why? La-la-la
Just tell me why? La-la-la
Just tell me why? La-la-la
Just tell me why? La-la-la
