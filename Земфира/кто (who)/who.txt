[Verse 1]
I will die in your hands
Let me stay in your hands
Cupid has failed his one task
Didn't have enough strength
Having minute regrets
Music will help me to love

[Chorus]
Who introduced you to the morning stars?
Who helped you train your night vision eyes?
Right, wasn't that me?
I, I will always by your side
I, I will always protect your pride
No, I won't let go

[Verse 2]
Ten minutes for our love
Ten minutes just to hug
Ten minutes are not enough
Slamming the brakes and I
Noticed it in your eyes
Something was off, wasn't right

[Chorus]
Who introduced you to the morning stars?
Who helped you train your night vision eyes?
Right, wasn't that me?
I, I will always by your side
I, I will always protect your pride
No, I won't let go

[Verse 3]
Counting years, but
Years keep growing; without you
I won't survive
Let's become friends at least
Kiss on the lips at least
For you to the stars I will strive

[Chorus]
Who introduced you to the morning stars?
Who helped you train your night vision eyes?
Right, wasn't that me?
I, I will always by your side
I, I will always protect your pride
No, I won't let go
