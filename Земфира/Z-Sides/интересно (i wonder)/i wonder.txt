[Verse 1]
Rain, the love admissions that have gone ignored
The poems carrying long trains of thoughts, they claim
The other day everything was alright
I'm dazed, the ocean's calling out for me
Unphased, I'm back, I've been inhaling smoke
Let's dance atop these pointy mountains

[Chorus]
Oh I wonder how you've been
I'll imagine you've been fine
Wish I knew how you have been

[Verse 2]
Still I see the moon is not facing my way
The train still moves throughout the darkest night
The lights are shining through the windows
Thanks to wine, I'm feeling wistful, longing for a day
When I can finally say I'm not alright
The rain will bring the news to me

[Chorus]
Oh I wonder how you've been
I'll imagine you've been fine
Wish I knew how you have been
I'll imagine you've been fine
Oh I wonder how you've been
I'll imagine you've been fine

[Outro]
You've been fine
