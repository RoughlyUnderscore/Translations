[Verse 1]
I'll write a letter with all my might
Just 20 words about my pride
It'll say that I'm writing out of spite
That fortune isn't on our side
But that aside

[Chorus]
Wait for me, I am sure that one day we will meet again
Wait for me, desperately believe that it's not in vain
Wait for me at the hub of the Sun, it's like a station
I can't catch on fire, I must not burn down
Wait for me, I believe one day I'll escape my bedroom
Wait for me, wait until the September rains shower you
Wait for me while they pray for me, while they believe in me
I must not burn down, I must not ignite them

[Verse 2]
I will stretch out my hand to you
There won't be any rings in sight
I'll hear the bullets flying through
I am your ticket to a flight
A one-way flight

[Chorus]
Wait for me, I am sure that one day we will meet again
Wait for me, desperately believe that it's not in vain
Wait for me at the hub of the Sun, it's like a station
I can't catch on fire, I must be on time
Wait for me, I believe one day I'll escape my bedroom
Wait for me, wait until the September rains drown you
Wait for me while they pray for me, while they believe in me
I must not burn down, I must not ignite them
