[Verse 1]
I wanna rip out my intestines, throw them in the sea
I wanna raise the money to invest in plastic surgery
I wanna cover myself head to toe in super sexy scars
'Cause I mean, aren't you supposed to burn if you're a star?

[Chorus]
I want to be torn apart excruciatingly
I punish my body 'cause it's not good enough for me
The scary thoughts are spreading like a weed
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed

[Verse 2]
I wanna take a knife and draw a line across my chest
I wanna feel much better than I do when I am at my best
I wanna fly away from my own skin and find a better place
I wanna slash across what used to be my face

[Chorus]
I want to be torn apart excruciatingly
I punish my body 'cause it's not good enough for me
The scary thoughts are spreading like a weed
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed

[Bridge]
They say that it gets better, but I guess that was a lie
I guess we all just fake it 'til we die
Sympathy and love we can extend to someone else
But it's harder when you have to love yourself

[Chorus]
I want to be torn apart excruciatingly
I punish my body 'cause it's not good enough for me
The scary thoughts are spreading like a weed
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
