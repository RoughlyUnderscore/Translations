[Verse 1]
The port wine's going stale, my heartbeat's going down
I was trying out life, what a waste of a trial, mhm
High credit score, scandalous fame, somebody's love, laughter and gains
There we go, a list of things that now can only inflict pain

[Chorus]
Take antidepressants just to feel like I'm not alive
So that I don't need to, don't need to, don't need to, don't need to make love and then look for love
It's not our fault that we can't express ourselves clearly
But now we don't have to, don't have to, don't have to, don't have to endure more anxiety

[Interlude]
Hm

[Verse 2]
Everything feels intertwined, cash, alcohol and smoke
Though it is a habit, being myself feels so wrong
The amount of times I used to think I knew it all
My inside is solely void but still, I can't let go

[Chorus]
Take antidepressants just to feel like I'm not alive
So that I don't need to, don't need to, don't need to, don't need to make love and then seek for love
It's not our fault that we can't express ourselves clearly
But now we don't have to, don't have to, don't have to, don't have to endure more anxiety
