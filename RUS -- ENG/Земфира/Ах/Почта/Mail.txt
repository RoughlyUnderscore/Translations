[Verse 1]
Plus twenty five outside, blazing hot season
But there's nowhere I can escape
Something's up with our Earth, don't know the reason
We're friends but things seem weird and fake

[Chorus]
As always in the dark night I'll purge my mails in dim light
As always when I wake I'll see I was onto something
Lonely in the dark night I'll purge my mails in dim light
As always when I wake I'll see I was onto something

[Verse 2]
Start the day off with a call and some tobacco
Coffee and smoke, no imminent doom
Such a fine line in how we talk to each other
No more face paint, the show's starting soon

[Chorus]
As always in the dark night I'll purge my mails in dim light
As always when I wake I'll see I was onto something
Lonely in the dark night I'll purge my mails in dim light
As always when I wake I'll see I was onto something

[Chorus]
As always in the dark night I'll purge my mails in dim light
As always when I wake I'll see I was onto something
Lonely in the dark night I'll purge my mails in dim light
As always when I wake I'll see I was onto something

[Outro]
As always in the dark night
As always when I wake though
Lonely in the dark night
