[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Loud silence, the evening feels eternal
You are quiet, I'm packing my belongings
Time is up, time doesn't really matter
Play pretend, exclaim that it'll be better
You'll go out and find someone who will spark your sparkless eyes
To your fractured soul's surprise, they will not be your demise
Chase the happy-ever-after
Trust me, I am not the answer

[Pre-Chorus]
Illusion, can't move on
I see scars on both, mhm

[Chorus]
Illusion, can't move on
I see scars on both your arms
Nemesis, your arch friend
I'm your personal red flag

[Verse 2]
You went through all (you went through all) of my venting (of my venting)
You desired (you desired) to be there (to be there)
You forgave me (you forgave me) for my cheating (for my cheating)
Oh, you loved me (yeah) - doesn't sit right with me
So go out and find someone who will spark your sparkless eyes
To your fractured soul's surprise, they will not be your demise
Chase the happy-ever-after
Trust me, I am not the answer

[Pre-Chorus]
I fucked my life up, I fucked my life up
I fucked my life up, I fucked my life up, yeah, hm

[Chorus]
Illusion, can't move on
I see scars on both your arms
Nemesis, your arch friend
I'm your personal red flag
Illusion, can't move on
I see scars on both your arms
Nemesis, your arch friend
Your eternally red flag

[Outro]
Your eternally red flag
