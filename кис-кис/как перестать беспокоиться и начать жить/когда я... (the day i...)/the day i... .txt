[Verse 1]
The wind will take my ashes, you'll watch me fly and scatter
I'll notice you and wave to tell you that the view is sick
No need to get all gloomy, the flight could not be better
You want to tackle death, but first make sure you've learned to live
You heard me right, and I'm still waiting for my alimony
My cat fell ill, the house is a mess, and my best friend has been captured by cops
All downhill, trying to climb up, your stepping stones are the heads of your opponents
Stop where you are, you'll be just fine, take a breath

[Chorus]
Oh, the day I die, birds will not stop chirping
Some will say: «He was quite fine, died from his own yearning»
From rejoice to compromises, people will go through emotions
On the day I die, la-la-la-la
Rumours often lie, with dishonest motives
They will claim: "He's just a guy, drinking, maybe smoking"
Life has me going in cycles and the only way to stop
Will be the very day I die, la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
So cold and empty here, I wish I had a blanket
Forgot to take it as I wrapped things up and left for good
The righteous will go right and the sinners will go left
They have got to rush to redistribute us to our groups
Time's flying by, I've got no money, just crippling depression
Not home alone, deafening kids, got no free time, every day is a chore
You're not burned out, you are not sick, you're just upset due to all of the pressure
Stop where you are, you'll be just fine, take a breath

[Chorus]
Oh, the day I die, birds will not stop chirping
They will say: «He was quite fine, died from his own yearning»
From rejoice to compromises, people will go through emotions
On the day I die, la-la-la-la
Rumours often lie, with dishonest motives
They will claim: "He's just a guy, drinking, maybe smoking"
Life has me going in cycles and the only way to stop
Will be the very day I die, la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
Oh, the day I die, birds will not stop chirping
They will say: «He was quite fine, died from his own yearning»
From rejoice to compromises, people will go through emotions
On the day I die, la-la-la-la
Rumours often lie, with dishonest motives
They will claim: "He's just a guy, drinking, maybe smoking"
Life has me going in cycles and the only way to stop
Will be the very day I die, la-la-la-la
